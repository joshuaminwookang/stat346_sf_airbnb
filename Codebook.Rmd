## About the Cases

This dataset has been initially published at Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The cases were identified through publicly available information through the Airbnb website. There are 8,111 unique listings and 100 variables that contribute to each listing.

## Why these Variables?
\begin{itemize}
\item Price: We will use Price as one of our main response variables. 
\item Overall Rating: We will use Overall Rating as one of our main response variables and will then use it as an explanatory variable to predict Price of listing. Please note, some listings do not have any ratings or reviews. The missing data is denoted with N/A.
\item Latitude: The latitude of the listing is a value between 37.7000 and 37.8000 which is the latitude of the area that San Fransisco spans.  
\item Longitude: The longitude of the listing is a value between -123.0000 and -122.0000 which is the longitude of the area that San Fransisco spans.
\item Neighborhood: along with the exact geographical coordinates, this categorical variable will help us expore how geographical proximiies between listings can correlate with their prices and ratings.
